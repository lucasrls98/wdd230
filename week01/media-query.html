            <h2>2 Nephi 2:27</h2>
            <p>27 Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose fliberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.</p>

            <h2>1 Nephi 1:1</h2>
            <p>1 I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.</p>
